Screen resolution may matter, so draw a small test picture first.
New in 1.8_beta: meteor shower command can spam white lines, which wipes out the red spam, or any other color you hate:)
New in 1.7: can print text either from file or from input; meteor shower can attack colors other than red or pink;
New in 1.6: can print words, 'meteor shower' command can also spam words on pink like 'LOL'
New in MS: add 'meteor shower' command to interrupt pink/blue spam.
New in 1.5: can draw beautiful curves.
New in 1.4: can preview the output image and control its color accuracy, improved color rendering, can manually recover if the position anchor (barcodes) is vandalized, enables ink-saving mode.

How to draw:

    1. Run the code or the .exe file.
    2. Follow the instructions on the command line.

Details about the command line options(to be completed...):

    2. Draw a website picture

        What is this:
            This command will automatically draw white stars or words on pink.
        How to use:
            Please use this command only when your computer is idle, and has enough ink(>3000).
            i) Zoom in to a place contaminated by pink, and set your pen size.
            ii) Choose to print stars or lines
				* Choose how many spams before enter to the next row(press enter for default).
				* If you would like to spam words, choose the printing speed, default is 7, lower is faster, if you set speed below 5, chances are your letters will appear distorted, making it more like hand-written ones.
			iii) Enjoy!
	
    5. Print text
	
	6. Exit
	
Caution:
    0. When painting a picture, it's recomended that you set your pen size(manually, the program won't do that) to be 1 or 2. If you set your pen size to be x, the output image will be scaled by x.
    1. Make sure the command window does not block the color wheel.
    2. If the image is large(>600*600), it may take several seconds to load.
    3. If the image is too large or too complicated, it may take very long to draw.
    4. If your screen resolution is not 1280*800 or 1366*768, you need to help the program to locate the color wheel.
